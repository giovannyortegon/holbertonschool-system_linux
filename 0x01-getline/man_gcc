NAME         top

       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler

SYNOPSIS         top

       gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard]
           [-g] [-pg] [-Olevel]
           [-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic]
           [-Idir...] [-Ldir...]
           [-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro]
           [-foption...] [-mmachine-option...]
           [-o outfile] [@file] infile...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
       remainder.  g++ accepts mostly the same options as gcc.

DESCRIPTION         top

       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
       assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
       process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the -c option says
       not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
       output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
       Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.
       Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are
       not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

       Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
       for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
       (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the
       description for a particular option does not mention a source
       language, you can use that option with all supported languages.

       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called gcc, or
       machine-gcc when cross-compiling, or machine-gcc-version to run a
       specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you should
       invoke GCC as g++ instead.

       The gcc program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
       options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
       options may not be grouped: -dv is very different from -d -v.

       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
       order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
       options of the same kind; for example, if you specify -L more than
       once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also, the
       placement of the -l option is significant.

       Many options have long names starting with -f or with -W---for
       example, -fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so on.  Most of these
       have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo is
       -fno-foo.  This manual documents only one of these two forms,
       whichever one is not the default.

       Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either by
       a space or by the equals sign (=) from the option name.  Unless
       documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or a string.
       Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or
       hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin with the 0x
       prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size threshold of some
       sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal integers
       followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes such
       as "kB" and "KiB" for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively, "MB" and
       "MiB" for megabyte and mebibyte, "GB" and "GiB" for gigabyte and
       gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are designated by byte-size in
       the following text.  Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant
       national and international standards for the full listing and
       explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.
